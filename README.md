# servo-test-learning
Learn how to move a servo and use GitHub

# Instructions
1. Take a look at the servo_example code and read the comments.
2. Fork this repository into your own GitHub account.
3. Create a new folder in the servo-test-learning directory and rename it to your username.
4. Create a new Arduino Sketch in the newly created folder.
5. Rewrite the code from the example, but change the code in the loop() function to make the servo do something unique.
6. Push your changes to your fork and commit.
7. Submit a Pull Request.

# Why use GitHub?
* We can collaborate on the same code
* We will have a record of all changes made to the code, so we can rollback the code if needed
* You can see the changes you are making to the code before committing
* You can make changes to your forks without modifying the master code on the main fork
* Issuing code reviews through pull requests is easier
